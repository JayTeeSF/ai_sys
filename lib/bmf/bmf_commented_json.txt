#  Authority, Logic and Emotion seem to be the key impacts on Will-power & decision-making

#  values seem to be some codification of ethos, pathos, and logos ...but they don't always line-up with the will!

#  We often decide contrary to our values



#  Calculus for how these aspects impact individual- and group-entities

#  "States" like "fatThe igue" have a score across all of the aspects (I.e. It impacts ones emotions as well as ones biology) it may even impact ones family

#  What do I focus on (right now): the fact that someone is giving me something, the thing they are giving, their tone, my options, my God's ability to handle this, etc

#  What does it mean: beginning, end, punishment, etc

#  Current state is one factor in decision making

#  What's your target (discover this ...it's not a decision ...its not a short-term goal)

#  What's you map (worldview, values) that tell you how to achieve your target: do means (not necc. the right thing) justify the ends (presumably the right thing)? Or do you believe in doing the right thing for right reasons, etc
